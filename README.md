vtchid-profiles
===============

Storage for some old controller-configs for the mighty Steel Battalion controller, used with the vtchid-driver in Windows XP.
You can find the vtchid-driver for this controller on this website: http://www.tamanegi.org/prog/vtchid/

I haven't uploaded my profile for Mechwarrior 4 yet, since I cannot find it ATM.
Most of it is based on the great work on this site, though: http://vt.beckament.net/
