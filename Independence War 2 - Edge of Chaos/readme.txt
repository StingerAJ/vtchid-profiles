Hello there,

I have created a config-pack for using the huge "Steel Battalion"-controller with I-War2. You need to get or build a XBOX-USB-cable and install the vtchid-driver from http://www.tamanegi.org/prog/vtchid/


You can put your dusting Steel Battalion-controller to good use with this config-pack!

You only need to install vtchid 0.2.1 from http://www.tamanegi.org/prog/vtchid/, connect the controller via a Smartjoy X2-USB cable or a selfbuilt-one, load up the appropiate vtchid-profile of choice (whether you want to use the pedals or not), and copy the iwar2-configfile into the <Game>\configs\ directory.

Select the control-config "vtc" in the iwar2-options ingame and off you go.

Some notes to the control-scheme:
- Autopilot and comms are on the Comm-Buttons naturally. Select the Autopilot/Commtarget-Mode with the Tuner Dial.
- Toggle "VT-Location Measurement" toggles between Fly-by-Wire On/Off.
- Toggle "Buffer Material" switches the Sight-Change-Stick between control of the HUD-Menu and Strafing thrusters (Axes RX and RY).
- Throttle is set with the Gear-Lever.
- Manual Thrust is given with Center-/Right-pedal. They can be very sensitive and dont always exactly center the axes U and V). Maybe I swap the axes u and V for the axes X and Y, because you can give them deadzones in flux.ini.

For the details, consult vtc.ini and iwar2pedals.sdp (driver-settings from vtchid) with a texteditor.

Have fun!
